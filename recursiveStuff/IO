 B. You can use the PrintWriter class for outputting text to a file.
 C. You can use the Scanner class for reading text from a file.
 D. An input object is also called an input stream.
 E. An output object is also called an output stream
 
 
 Which method can you use to find out the number of the bytes in a file using InputStream?
 
 B. available()
 
 
 
 Which of the following statements are true?
 A. All methods in FileInputStream/FileOutputStream are inherited from InputStream/OutputStream.
 B. You can create a FileInputStream/FileOutputStream from a File object or a file name using FileInputStream/FileOutputStream constructors.
 C. The return value -1 from the read() method signifies the end of file.
 D. A java.io.FileNotFoundException would occur if you attempt to create a FileInputStream with a nonexistent file.
 
 
 
 To append data to an existing file, use _____________ to construct a FileOutputStream for file out.dat.
 
 C. new FileOutputStream("out.dat", true)
 
 Which of the following statements is correct to create a DataOutputStream to write to a file named out.dat?

 B. DataOutputStream outfile = new DataOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("out.dat"));
 
 
 
 After the following program is finished, how many bytes are written to the file t.dat?

import java.io.*;

public class Test {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
    DataOutputStream output = new DataOutputStream(
      new FileOutputStream("t.dat"));
    output.writeShort(1234);
    output.writeShort(5678);
    output.close();
  }
}
 
 B. 4 bytes.
 
 
 
 
  After the following program is finished, how many bytes are written to the file t.dat?

import java.io.*;

public class Test {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
    DataOutputStream output = new DataOutputStream(
      new FileOutputStream("t.dat"));
    output.writeChar('A');
    output.close();
  }
}
 A. 2 bytes.
 
 
 import java.io.*;

public class Test {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
    DataOutputStream output = new DataOutputStream(
      new FileOutputStream("t.dat"));
    output.writeUTFString("ABCD");
    output.close();
  }
}
 'ABCD' are ASCII code, so each takes one byte in UTF. Total is 6 because the first two bytes stores the number of characters in the string.
 C. 6 bytes.
 
 
 Which of the following statements are true?
 A. All files are stored in binary format. So, all files are essentially binary files.
 B. Text I/O is built upon binary I/O to provide a level of abstraction for character encoding and decoding. 
 C. Encoding and decoding are automatically performed by text I/O. 
 D. For binary input, you need to know exactly how data were written in order to read them in correct type and order. 
 
 
 
 Which of the following statements are true?
 A. ObjectInputStream/ObjectOutputStream enables you to perform I/O for objects in addition for primitive type values and strings.
 B. Since ObjectInputStream/ObjectOutputStream contains all the functions of DataInputStream/DataOutputStream, you can replace DataInputStream/DataOutputStream completely by ObjectInputStream/ObjectOutputStream. 
 C. To write an object, the object must be serializable.
 D. The Serializable interface does not contain any methods. So it is a mark interface.
 E. If all the elements in an array is serializable, the array is serializable too.
 
 
 The Loan class given in the text does not implement java.io.Serializable. Analyze the following code.

public class Foo implements java.io.Serializable {  
  private int v1;
  private static double v2;
  private Loan v3 = new Loan();
}
 
 B. An instance of Foo cannot be serialized because Foo contains a non-serializable instance variable v3.
 C. If you mark v3 as transient, an instance of Foo is serializable.
 
 
 Which of the following statements is true?
 
 C. An object must be an instance of Serializable for it to be serialized.
 
 
 To create a file, you can use __________.
 A. FileOutputStream
 B. FileWriter
 C. RandomAccessFile
 D. All of the above
 
 
 
 With which I/O class can you append or update a file?
 A. RandomAccessFile()
